¥begin{abstract}
This document is a guide for preparing drafts 
and the camera-ready manuscripts using the {¥LaTeX} style file
to be submitted to the DPS Workshop (DPSWS). 
Since this document itself is produced with the style files, 
it will help you to refer to its source file.

¥section{Paper Format for Submission}

If you would like to submit a paper 
for the DPS Workshop (DPSWS) using {¥LaTeX}, 
you have to use the class file ¥texttt{dpsws.cls}. 
If you write your paper in Japanese, 
please indicate your paper format 
at the top of your tex source file as follows: 

¥begin{verbatim}

¥documentclass[submit,techreq,noauthor]{dpsws}

¥end{verbatim}

If you write your paper in English, 
indicate your paper format as follows: 

¥begin{verbatim}

¥documentclass[techreq,english]{dpsws}

¥end{verbatim}

The files for DPSWS, ¥texttt{dpsws.cls} and ¥texttt{dpsws.sty}, are created by deleting the header and footer from ¥texttt{ipsj.cls} and ¥texttt{ipsjtech.sty}, respectively.
In case of a Japanese paper, we have also deleted the English title, authors, and abstract.
For the detail of the paper format, 
please refer to the IPSJ journal style guide
provided at the URL
http://www.ipsj.or.jp/english/jip/submit/ronbun¥_e¥_prms.html
¥cite{ipsjEFormat}. 

Please do not ask IPSJ for the style files of DPSWS. 
DPSWS organizing committee 
also will not support preparation of your paper in principle. 
However, 
if you have any necessary questions on the paper style, 
please contact the organizing committee. 


¥section{Troubleshooting about Character Code}

The files for DPSWS are encoded in Shift JIS code for Windows users.
If you use the files on other systems and meet an error due to the encoding, please convert them by an appropriate encoding format, for example, EUC and UTF-8.
